# Importance sampling for outliers

Unlike bootstrap resampling, importance sampling is not typically used directly for outlier detection. Rather, it is used to improve the efficiency of statistical estimation procedures, particularly in situations where the quantity of interest is rare or the sampling from the target distribution is difficult.

In the context of outlier detection, importance sampling might be useful in scenarios where the data is heavily imbalanced, and outliers represent a rare event. However, it's worth noting that this would not be the standard or most straightforward approach to outlier detection, as it requires a careful selection of the proposal distribution and might be more computationally intensive than other methods.

In this example, we first generate a synthetic dataset data that is mostly composed of samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, but also includes some outliers from a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 0.5.

We then define the target and proposal distributions based on the data and use the outlier_detection_importance_sampling function to estimate the proportion of outliers. The outliers are defined as data points that are more than three standard deviations away from the mean.

Please note that the proposal distribution is chosen to be wider than the target distribution to improve the chances of sampling the rare outliers, and the number of samples N is set to a large number (10,000) to get a reliable estimate. The choice of the threshold for outlier detection is often problem-specific and may require some experimentation.

# Control Variates
Control variates is a method where we use the known expected values of certain variables to help estimate the expected value of other variables. The control variable should be one that is correlated with the function of interest and has a known expected value [5]. The basic idea is to reduce the variance by subtracting the control variate from the function of interest and adding back its known expected value.
