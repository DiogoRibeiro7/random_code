# Importance sampling for outliers

Unlike bootstrap resampling, importance sampling is not typically used directly for outlier detection. Rather, it is used to improve the efficiency of statistical estimation procedures, particularly in situations where the quantity of interest is rare or the sampling from the target distribution is difficult.

In the context of outlier detection, importance sampling might be useful in scenarios where the data is heavily imbalanced, and outliers represent a rare event. However, it's worth noting that this would not be the standard or most straightforward approach to outlier detection, as it requires a careful selection of the proposal distribution and might be more computationally intensive than other methods.

In this example, we first generate a synthetic dataset data that is mostly composed of samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, but also includes some outliers from a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 0.5.

We then define the target and proposal distributions based on the data and use the outlier_detection_importance_sampling function to estimate the proportion of outliers. The outliers are defined as data points that are more than three standard deviations away from the mean.

Please note that the proposal distribution is chosen to be wider than the target distribution to improve the chances of sampling the rare outliers, and the number of samples N is set to a large number (10,000) to get a reliable estimate. The choice of the threshold for outlier detection is often problem-specific and may require some experimentation.

# Control Variates
Control variates is a method where we use the known expected values of certain variables to help estimate the expected value of other variables. The control variable should be one that is correlated with the function of interest and has a known expected value [5]. The basic idea is to reduce the variance by subtracting the control variate from the function of interest and adding back its known expected value.

# quasi-Monte Carlo methods
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are a group of techniques used in numerical integration that are known to have superior convergence properties as compared to standard (random) Monte Carlo methods. Instead of random sampling, these methods use low-discrepancy sequences, also known as quasi-random sequences, to cover the sampling space more uniformly. The Sobol sequence and Halton sequence are examples of low-discrepancy sequences.

## quasi monte carlo methods for outliers
Using Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for outlier detection is not very typical, because the method isn't geared towards finding rare events, but more towards achieving a more evenly distributed sampling across the space. However, it's possible to use it for sampling the data space and then apply a function to detect the outliers.

Here's a basic example of how you might use it. We generate a Sobol sequence of data, apply a function to detect outliers, and then count the proportion of outliers. For the outlier detection, we will simply consider values above a certain threshold as outliers, but in practice you might use a more sophisticated method

# Multilevel Monte Carlo Methods

The Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo estimations. It works by approximating the quantity of interest at multiple levels of accuracy and then combining these approximations in a way that minimizes the overall variance of the estimate. The idea is to do most of the work at lower levels (where the approximation is cheaper but less accurate), and then correct these approximations with more expensive but more accurate computations at higher levels.

## Multilevel Monte Carlo Methods for outliers

Sure, we can perform a multilevel Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the parameters of a dataset, then use these parameters to create a model for the data, and finally flag anything that falls outside a particular range as an outlier.

However, please note that the actual implementation of MLMC for outlier detection could be highly dependent on your specific problem and the nature of the data.

# Coupling From The Past 

"Coupling From The Past" (CFTP) is a method for exact sampling from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. It was introduced by Propp and Wilson in 1996.

In simple terms, the idea behind CFTP is to run copies of the Markov chain starting from every possible initial state, all simultaneously, until all the chains "couple" or coalesce into a single state. This final state is then guaranteed to be a sample from the stationary distribution.

Implementing CFTP for a general case in Python can be complex, but let's see a simple example using a Markov chain for a biased coin flip.


let's consider an example involving the Ising model, which is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics.

The Ising model is a simple binary value system where each site on a lattice has a spin that can take values of +1 or -1. The total energy of the system is given by the sum of the interactions between neighboring spins. The probability of a particular configuration is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

To make the problem tractable, we'll consider a 1D Ising model. We'll use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to define our Markov chain, and we'll use CFTP to sample from the stationary distribution of this Markov chain.

Please note that this is a fairly advanced example and requires some familiarity with statistical physics.

## Coupling From The Past for outliers


Applying "Coupling From The Past" (CFTP) specifically for outlier detection might not be straightforward or intuitive.

Outlier detection typically involves analyzing a dataset to identify items that deviate significantly from the norm or the majority of the data. Techniques such as Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), or Isolation Forest are often used for this purpose.

CFTP, on the other hand, is a technique used to sample exactly from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. It's generally used in the context of Monte Carlo simulations and probabilistic modeling, not specifically for outlier detection.

However, one potential way to use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method like CFTP in outlier detection could be to model your data as a stochastic process, and treat observations that have a very low probability under the model as outliers. This would involve using CFTP to fit the model parameters, and then using the fitted model to compute the probability of each observation.

Here is a very rough and conceptual outline of how such an approach could work:

Use CFTP to fit a Markov chain model to your data. This would involve defining a transition matrix that describes the probabilities of moving from each state to each other state, and using CFTP to find the stationary distribution of this Markov chain.

Use the fitted Markov chain model to compute the probability of each observation in your dataset. This would involve starting from the initial state of the chain and computing the probability of observing the sequence of states represented by your data.

Identify any observations that have a very low probability under the model as outliers. This would involve setting a threshold for what constitutes a "low" probability, and flagging any observations below this threshold as potential outliers.

Remember that this is just a conceptual approach and would need to be tailored to the specifics of your dataset and problem. It's also important to keep in mind that this approach may not be appropriate or effective for all types of data or outlier detection problems.

In this script, we first generate some data using a Markov chain with a known transition matrix and then inject a few outliers. We then compute the log-probability of each observation under the Markov chain model and identify the observations with the lowest log-probabilities as potential outliers.

This is a very simplistic approach and may not work well in practice, especially for more complex data and models. In a real-world scenario, you would typically need to use a more advanced method to model your data and detect outliers. As always, it's important to take into account the specifics of your dataset and problem when choosing an approach.

Remember that this code assumes that you already have a fitted Markov Chain model (i.e., the transition matrix is known). If the transition matrix is not known, you would need to estimate it from the data, which could be a complex task in itself. Also, this code uses the naive approach of just looking at the log-probabilities of the transitions; in practice, you might want to consider more sophisticated approaches to score the "outlierness" of the data points.
