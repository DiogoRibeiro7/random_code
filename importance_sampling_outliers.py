# Unlike bootstrap resampling, importance sampling is not typically used directly for outlier detection. Rather, it is used to improve the efficiency of statistical estimation procedures, particularly in situations where the quantity of interest is rare or the sampling from the target distribution is difficult.

# In the context of outlier detection, importance sampling might be useful in scenarios where the data is heavily imbalanced, and outliers represent a rare event. However, it's worth noting that this would not be the standard or most straightforward approach to outlier detection, as it requires a careful selection of the proposal distribution and might be more computationally intensive than other methods.

# Here's a conceptual example where we try to estimate the proportion of data points that fall beyond a certain threshold using importance sampling:


from typing import Callable
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

def outlier_detection_importance_sampling(data: np.ndarray, threshold: float, target_dist: Callable[[float], float], proposal_dist: Callable[[float], float], proposal_sampler: Callable[[], float], N: int) -> float:
    """

    proposal_sampler : Callable[[], float]
        The function to draw samples from the proposal distribution.
    N : int
        The number of samples to draw.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The estimated proportion of outliers.
